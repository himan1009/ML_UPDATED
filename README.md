# 🧠 Machine Learning & AI Learning Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to learning **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Deep Learning (DL)**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Generative AI**. This repo serves as a centralized resource where I practice, document, and share my journey through real-world projects, concept notebooks, and hands-on implementations using Python and popular libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face.
